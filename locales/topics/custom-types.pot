msgid "Sometimes you may want to write your own custom types for use and reuse in CWL descriptions. Use of such custom types can reduce redundancy between multiple descriptions that all use the same type, and also allow for additional customisation/configuration of a tool/analysis without the need to fiddle with the CWL description directly."
