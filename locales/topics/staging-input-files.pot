msgid "Normally, input files are located in a read-only directory separate from the output directory.  This causes problems if the underlying tool expects to write its output files alongside the input file in the same directory.  You use `InitialWorkDirRequirement` to stage input files into the output directory. In this example, we use a JavaScript expression to extract the base name of the input file from its leading directory path."
