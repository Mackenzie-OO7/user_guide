That means that any genuine need for the character `$` must be **escaped** with `\\`. For instance, `\\${PREFIX}` above is expanded to `${PREFIX}` in the generated file to be evaluated by the shell script instead of the CWL engine."

msgid "`InitialWorkDirRequirement` requires a `listing`. As the `listing` is a YAML array, we need a `-` on the first line of each element of the array, in this case we have just one element. `entryname:` can have any value, but it must match what was specified in the `baseCommand`. The final part is `entry:`, this is followed by `|-` which is YAML quoting syntax, and means that you are using a multiline string (without it, we would need to write the whole script on one line)."
