msgid "Often, tool descriptions will be written for a specific version of a software. To make it easier for others to use your descriptions, you can include a `SoftwareRequirement` field in the `hints` section. This may also help to avoid confusion about which version of a tool the description was written for."

msgid "As well as a version number, a unique resource identifier (URI) for the tool is given in the form of an [RRID][rrid]. Resources with RRIDs can be looked up in the [SciCrunch][scicrunch] registry, which provides a portal for finding, tracking, and referring to scientific resources consistently. If you want to specify a tool as a `SoftwareRequirement`, search for the tool on SciCrunch and use the RRID that it has been assigned in the registry. (Follow this [Adding a Resource Tutorial][scicrunch-add-tool] to add a tool to SciCrunch). You can use this RRID to refer to the tool (via [identifiers.org][identifiers]) in the `specs` field of your requirement description. Other good choices, in order of preference, are to include the DOI for the main tool citation and the URL to the tool."
