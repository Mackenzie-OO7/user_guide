msgid "This section describes the basic concepts for users to get started on working with Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflows. Readers are expected to be familiar with workflow managers, YAML, and comfortable with following instructions for the command-line. The other sections of the user guide cover the same concepts, but in more detail. If you are already familiar with CWL or you are looking for more advanced content, you may want to skip this section."

The last number is used for bug fixes, like typos and other corrections to the specification."
